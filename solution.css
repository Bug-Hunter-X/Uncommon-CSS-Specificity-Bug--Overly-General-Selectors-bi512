The following CSS rule demonstrates a more specific way to target only the intended elements within the container, resolving the issue:

```css
#myContainer p { color: blue; }
/*OR*/
.container > p { color: blue; }
```

The `#myContainer` selector ensures that only paragraphs within the element with the ID `myContainer` are affected. Alternatively, `.container > p` ensures that only direct children paragraphs within the element having the class `container` are targeted.
